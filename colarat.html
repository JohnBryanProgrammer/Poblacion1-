Mabuhay! I hope everyone is doing well and in good health! As your Punong Barangay, I want to take this opportunity to address two crucial aspects that are essential for the progress and well-being of our community: Peace and Order and Livelihood for development.
 
First and foremost, maintaining peace and order is of utmost importance to ensure the safety and security of every resident. We understand that a peaceful environment is the foundation for growth and prosperity. Therefore, we are committed to working hand in hand with the local government, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders to create a safe and harmonious community. Through the implementation of effective peace and order programs, we aim to combat criminal activities, drug proliferation, and corruption. By fostering a culture of cooperation and vigilance, we can create an environment where everyone feels secure and protected.
 
In addition to peace and order, we recognize the significance of livelihood opportunities for the development of our barangay. We understand that sustainable economic growth is vital for improving the quality of life for our residents. With this in mind, we are dedicated to promoting livelihood programs and initiatives that will empower individuals and families to become self-reliant and financially stable. We will actively seek partnerships with government agencies, non-government organizations, and private entities to provide training, resources, and support for various livelihood endeavors. By harnessing the skills and talents of our community, we can create a vibrant local economy that benefits us all.
 
I urge each and every one of you to actively participate in our efforts to maintain peace and order and promote livelihood development. Your cooperation, support, and engagement are crucial in achieving our shared vision of a thriving and harmonious barangay. Together, we can build a community where every resident can live in peace, security, and prosperity.
 
Thank you for your unwavering support, and may we continue to work hand in hand towards a brighter future for Brgy. Poblacion 1, Tubay.

Empowering Communities for Peaceful Living, Healthy Lives, and Sustainable Livelihoods.
 
Sincerely,
 
HON. LELUCITO B. REGALA
Punong Barangay

    <h5 class="card-title">History</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Since 1898, Tubay was a prosperous town but when the Americans visited Tubay and Cabadbaran, they were convinced that the latter was the better seat of government. Therefore, in 1903, Tubay was reduced to a barrio to give ways its equally thriving neighbor Cabadbaran. Although reduced to a barrio status, it still remained a center of commercial activities due to the presence of Chinese merchants there. Boom in business in Tubay was still noticeable until the early and fabulous 20’s when the navigable Jabonga River was still the chief artery of its copra and hemp traffic. However, when the provincial road connecting Cabadbaran to Butuan and Cabadbaran to Santiago was finished, business in Tubay began to decline and business through the Jabonga River slowly disappeared

    <p class="card-text">Poblacion 1 is a barangay in the municipality of Tubay, in the province of Agusan del Norte. Its population as determined by the 2020 Census was 1,994. This represented 7.73% of the total population of Tubay.Tubay, which was named after its brave founder Datu Tabay, lays claim to being the second Spanish settlement in Agusan. Formerly, the people settled in the wilderness of Ilihan, then transferred to sitio Malubog and later to tubay-tubay and Sebang near the mouth of the Jabonga River. However, the danger of constant inundation and Moro attacks convinced the succeeding  leaders of the place to move the pueblo Daan Lungsod where now survives the massive magkuno posts of a once strongly built spacious church. And it was here the settlement firmly took roots.
